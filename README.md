# ⚙️ Requirements and Dependencies

Before starting, ensure the required technologies are installed.

- **Node.JS** >= v22.10
- **NPM** >= v10
- **MySQL** >= 8.0



# 🚀 How to Run the Solution

In the examples of all commands in the text `<env>` is the name of the environment to perform the migration, e.g. `dev`,
`test` or `prod`.

1. Clone this repository and move to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> univent-backend
   cd univent-backend
   ```
2. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. For development purposes use `dev` environment. Configure the database connection by copying the
   `.env.development.example` to a new file `.env.development`. After that put your MySQL credentials of root user:
    ```
    # Database Root Configuration
    DB_ROOT_HOST=localhost
    DB_ROOT_PORT=3306
    DB_ROOT_USER=root
    DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
    ```
   Also, new DB user `uevent_sql` will be created after executing the next command. Credentials of `uevent_sql` user can be changed:
    ```
    # Database App Configuration
    DB_APP_HOST=localhost
    DB_APP_PORT=3306
    DB_APP_USER=univent_sql
    DB_APP_PASSWORD=securepass
    DB_APP_DATABASE=univent
    ```
   For test purposes use `test` environment: create `.env.test` file by copying the `.env.test.example` file.
4. Run script for create databases and user:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:db
   ```
5. Run command to apply necessary migrations.
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```
6. Run command to create prisma client:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:generate
   ```
7. Run command to build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
8. Seeds help you fill your database with initial data for a presentation or project launch. To start creating test data, run the command:
    ```bash
    npm run migrate:seed
    ```
    or run following command to rewrite data:
    ```bash
    npm run migrate:refresh
    ```
9. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```
10. Application will be launched on [http://localhost:8080/api](http://localhost:8080/api).



# 🐋 Docker
Environment variables are taken from `.env.development` file. You can start containers with the command:
```
docker-compose --env-file .env.development up -d
```
To view a list of containers:
```
docker ps -a
```
To stop running containers:
```
docker-compose stop
```
To stop and delete containers, networks, and associated resources (with volumes):
```
docker-compose down -v
```



# 📫 Mailing Service

The application uses **Gmail API** for production email delivery with OAuth2 authentication, providing reliable and secure email sending capabilities.

### Gmail API Configuration

The application is configured to use Gmail API for sending emails in production. To set up Gmail integration:

1. Google Cloud Console Setup:
   - Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Enable Gmail API for your project
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
   - Add your redirect URI for OAuth flow
2. Environment Configuration:
   Configure the following variables in your `.env.development` file:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_GMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
   GOOGLE_GMAIL_API_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri
   ```
3. OAuth2 Flow:
   - Use Google OAuth2 flow to obtain refresh token
   - The application automatically refreshes access tokens as needed

### Development Testing with Ethereal
For development and testing purposes, you can use [Ethereal Email](https://ethereal.email/) - a fake SMTP service where messages are captured but never delivered.

Default test credentials:
* login: ```ricky43@ethereal.email```
* password: ```4e1zbM2nxsMu2d823E```

### Email Templates
Email types supported:
- Account email confirmation
- Password reset notifications  
- Welcome emails for new companies
- Ticket confirmation with PDF attachments

### Importing the Collection into Postman
Follow these steps to import and set up the Univent Postman collection:

1. Open Postman:
    * Launch the Postman application on your computer.
2. Import the Collection:
    * Click the Import button in the top-left corner of Postman.
    * In the import dialog, select Choose Files and navigate to the [univent.postman_collection.json](./docs/postman/univent.postman_collection.json) file in your project directory.
    * Alternatively, drag and drop the [univent.postman_collection.json](./docs/postman/univent.postman_collection.json) file into the import dialog.
    * Click Import to load the collection into Postman.
3. Verify the Collection:
    * Once imported, the "univent" collection will appear in the Collections sidebar on the left.
    * Expand the collection to view the organized folders (e.g., Auth, Users, Companies, Events, etc.).
    * The collection uses variables like `{{url}}`, `{{csrfToken}}`, `{{accessToken}}`, and `{{refreshToken}}` to dynamically configure requests.
    ![postman_env_variables](./docs/postman/env_variables.png)
    * Create a new Postman environment or update an existing one:
        * Click the Environments tab in Postman.
        * Create a new environment (e.g., "Univent") or select an existing one.
        * Add the following variables (initial values are provided in the collection's variable section): 
        * url: Set to http://localhost:8080/api (or your API's base URL).
            * `csrfToken`: Initially set to a placeholder (e.g., 8gAKNsET-yxO1S-Qny8PrGewCQ_qnn5yc6qE). This will be updated automatically by the "Get CSRF Token" request.
            * `accessToken`: Placeholder for the JWT access token, updated by the "Login" or "Refresh Access Token" requests.
            * `refreshToken`: Placeholder for the JWT refresh token, updated by the "Login" request.
            * `passwordResetLink` and confirmEmailLink: Optional variables for password reset and email confirmation links.
            * `baseUrl`: Optional variable for additional URL configurations.
        * Save the environment and select it from the environment dropdown in Postman.
5. Test the Collection:
    * Start by running the Get CSRF Token request in the Auth folder. This request retrieves a CSRF token and stores it in the csrfToken variable using a Postman test script.
    * Proceed to the Register or Login requests to authenticate and obtain accessToken and refreshToken values, which are automatically stored by test scripts.
    * Use the authenticated tokens to test other endpoints (e.g., retrieving event subscriptions, creating orders, or validating promo codes).
