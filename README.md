- **MySQL** >= 8.0


## üöÄ How to Run the Solution
1. Clone this repository and move to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure the database connection by copying [.env.example](.env.example) to new file `.env`. After that put your MySQL credentials of root and new DB user:
    ```
    # Database Root Configuration
    DB_ROOT_HOST=localhost
    DB_ROOT_PORT=3306
    DB_ROOT_USER=root
    DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=root

    # Database App Configuration
    DB_APP_HOST=localhost
    DB_APP_PORT=3306
    DB_APP_USER=uevent_sql
    DB_APP_PASSWORD=securepass
    DB_APP_DATABASE=uevent
    ```
4. Run script for create databases and user:
   ```bash
   npm run setupdb
   ```
5. Run command to apply necessary migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```
6. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
   ```
7. Application will be launched on [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api).


## üì´ Mailing Service
[Ethereal](https://ethereal.email/) is a fake SMTP service, mostly aimed at Nodemailer and EmailEngine users (but not limited to). It's a completely free anti-transactional email service where messages never get delivered.
To view the letter that the user will receive, you need to log in to this service using a test login and password. Default credentials you can find in [.env.example](.env.example) or:
* login:
    ```text
    ricky43@ethereal.email
    ```
* password:
    ```text
    4e1zbM2nxsMu2d823E
    ```

## üîÅ REST API documentation
The documentation of all available endpoints can be found [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs). The [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) library is used.


## ü™≤ Unit Testing
Start the server with the command:
```bash
npm run start
```
Once the dependencies are installed and the backend is running, you can run the tests. To do this, use the command:
Running all tests:
```bash
npm run test
```
Run all tests with detailed report:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```
